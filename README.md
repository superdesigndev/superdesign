## 🧠 Supported AI Providers

SuperDesign supports multiple AI providers. You can configure your preferred provider and model in the settings.

- **Anthropic:** Claude models
- **OpenAI:** GPT models
- **Google:** Gemini models
- **OpenRouter:** Access a wide range of models

To configure an API key, use the Command Palette (`Cmd+Shift+P`) and search for "Superdesign: Configure [Provider] API Key".

## Can I use my own Claude Code or Cursor subscription?

Yes, after you initialise superdesign extension, some cursor/claude code rules will be added, so you can prompt the agent to do design and preview in superdesign canva (cmd + shift + p -> superdesign: open canva)

If using Cursor - I will highly suggest copy the prompt in 'design.mdc' and create a custom mode in cursor with that same system prompt; This should give you much better performance
